# About

Contains two methods, one to encrypt, one to decrypt a string used to secure a connection string for Entity Framework Core code first.

> The level of encrypt/decryption used here was picked at random, there are less and more secure methods, what a developer selects should be dependent on if they believe someone will be able to hack the application or not.
